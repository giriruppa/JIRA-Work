## 🚀 **Overview**

The **JIRA Agile Showcase** demonstrates my practical understanding of **Agile Software Development**, **Scrum Framework**, and **QA/Test Management** using **Atlassian JIRA**.
This setup includes **two projects**, multiple **epics and user stories**, **custom dashboards**, and a **strategic product roadmap (VDP2)** reflecting end-to-end agile delivery.

---

## 🧠 **Agile Methodology Implementation**

### **Product Roadmap – VDP2 (Vision, Direction, Planned Progress)**

| **Component**                 | **Description**                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vision & Goals**            | Build secure, automated, and intelligent DevSecOps and Cloud Security monitoring solutions.                 |
| **Epics & Themes**            | Each project has 6 epics grouped under major security & automation themes.                                  |
| **Features & Prioritization** | Features categorized as **Must Have**, **Should Have**, **Could Have**, and **Won’t Have** for each sprint. |
| **Release Planning**          | Bi-weekly sprints with sprint backlog and velocity tracking.                                                |
| **Backlog Management**        | Product backlog refined with user stories, tasks, and subtasks before sprint planning.                      |
| **Timelines**                 | Milestones visualized via **Calendar** and **Roadmap** views for continuous delivery.                       |

* **Epic 4:** Compliance & Audit → Automated CIS Benchmark Reports
* **Epic 5:** Threat Intelligence → TI feed integration for event enrichment
* **Epic 6:** Dashboard UI → Splunk-based visualization & severity insights

📊 **Backlog:** User stories organized under sprint backlog → each story divided into tasks & subtasks.
📅 **Calendar:** Sprint cycles visualized with due dates and issue deadlines.
🧾 **Board:** Active Sprint Board showing workflow (To Do → In Progress → Done).
